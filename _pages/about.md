I am a Phd student at Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences starting in September 2022, supervised by [Kai Chen](https://kaichen.org). Before that, I received my bachelor degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I'm also a member of the CTF team [NeSE](https://nese.team) since 2022, specialized in reverse engineering and AI related tasks.

My research interests include artificial intelligent security and software security. I'm working on engineering a decompiler incorporating Aritificial Intelligence and Program Analysis.
